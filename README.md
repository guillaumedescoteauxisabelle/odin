## --@STCGoal Odin project's goal is an optimal environment for creating 
* using every form of digital art. It aim to contain many modules from other project (as you wish, consider Odin is a packaging of other module)  The end-result (I hope) will be that you clone it and you got all I created and ready to use for creating.  I also desire to protect some creations in their germination phase that I will add as submodule it this project (until these become mature and also to stimulate partners to fund my researches (which would look like they could be added to the project as contributor and access to the content early than public (giving them competitive advantages of integrating that in their pipeline right away along with another opportunity for contributing to its creation (influencing the innovative path as sometime I am expecting partners to have valuable issues to structurally analyze and use as starting point for the resolution process))))
